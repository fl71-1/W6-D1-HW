        Jabal Al-Souda, in the Asir region of southwestern Saudi Arabia,
         is one of the country's highest peaks, standing at 3,015 meters. 
         Famous for its cool climate and misty weather, the mountain is
          covered in dense juniper forests, creating a unique contrast to
           the typical desert scenery of Saudi Arabia. Al-Souda is a popular
            summer destination, offering hiking trails and scenic views over 
            the valleys, with cooler temperatures than other parts of the Kingdom. ​​
