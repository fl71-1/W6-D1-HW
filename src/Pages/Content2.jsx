Jabal Tuwaiq is a prominent mountain range in central Saudi Arabia,
 spanning 800 kilometers from Al Zulfi in the north to the Rub' 
 al Khali desert in the south. It is one of the Kingdom's most 
 famous geographical landmarks and serves as a symbol of Saudi heritage
  and resilience. The range gained further recognition after being mentioned by
   Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
 drawing significant local and international interest.
